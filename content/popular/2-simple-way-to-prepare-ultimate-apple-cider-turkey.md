- "5 sprigs fresh Italian flat leaf parsley"
- " Pan"
- "4 apples quartered"
- "4 stocks of celery"
- "1/4 large sweet onion"
- "12 oz hard apple cider"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put 1/2 gallon of apple cider, salt and sugar into a large pan. Heat and stir until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Now mix all brine ingredients into a food safe bucket. Submerge the turkey completely and let brine for a minimum of 8 hours, 12 to 24 is best."
- "Once brined pat dry and let rest while preparing the pan for roasting. The skin has started to take on a little color from the brine."
- "Preheat oven to 350째"
- "If using a disposable foil roasting pan place it onto a baking sheet for additional support. Spread out the ingredients for the pan in an even layer."
- "Stuff and truss the turkey. Trussing not just helps the turkey cook evenly but also simply helps keep the cavity ingredients inside. Get the turkey into the pan and pour in the hard apple cider. All the pan ingredients add great flavor and create an amazing base for gravy."
- "Roast for an hour and a half breast side down. This helps keep the breast meat moist."
- "Now flip over and cook until the breast meat is 165째. Baste with the pan juices every half hour or so. This is my new favorite turkey, I will be making this a few times a year at least!!!"
